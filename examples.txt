Pakistan's largest airport has resumed operations after an assault by militants which left at least 28 people, including the attackers, dead.

The assault on Jinnah international airport in Karachi began late on Sunday, with security forces gaining control in the early hours of Monday.

The Pakistani Taliban have said they carried out the raid as revenge for the killing of their leader last year.

A government spokesman said a full investigation was under way.

Asif Kirmani, a political secretary to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, also praised the security forces for their response.
